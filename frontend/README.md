# EdVantageâ€”Frontend

## Getting Started
### Local Development

First, install package dependencies: 

```bash
npm install 
# or
yarn i
# or
pnpm i
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the web application running locally.

## Docker

You can also run the frontend in a Docker container, although hot-reloading is currently not supported.

Refer to the root [README](../README.md#docker) for detailed instructions.


The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
