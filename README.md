## Project Description
Client: Riordan Alfredo

Description: Automated Query Engine integrated with ChatGPT to query for more in depth explanation or examples when students are stuck on some concepts when watching an educational video. 
* Students can ask for recommendations from the video (or a “recommend me” button, if automation is too advanced)
*  There should be a system to extract recent conversation in the video (within 5-10 seconds before & after the pause) -> query it to GPT-3, and return an explanation/examples/summary to promote self-regulated learning
*  Students need to create a video platform, where teachers can add videos/contents, see some analytics, and students can view and learn.

## Basic Requirements
- Build a platform to upload and view videos
- Query the text before and after the pause to find related topics 
- Display them to the student neatly 
- Analytics to for teachers to understand which topics needed the most help
